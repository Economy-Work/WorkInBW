# WorkInBW
## About the Project:
This Project is a Web-Based Plattform, which help foreign specialized workers to find the perfect workingplace in Baden-Württemberg.

## Used Technologies:
The Backend is made with PHP.
For the evaluation of the questions and tasks sheet we use Pyhton and AI.

## How it works:
The worker who wants to work in Germany/Baden-Württemberg signs up and can start to fill out the question sheet.
After filling out the question sheet, the next step is to do a speaking task and after that a writing task.
After all questions and tasks, the answers get evaluated and the results are shown.
