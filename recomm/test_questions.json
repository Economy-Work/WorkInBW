When you use a VPN, the data from the client is sent to a point in the VPN where it is encrypted and then sent through the internet to another point.", "What is a Botnet?": "A Botnet is a number of devices connected to the internet where each device has one or more bots running on it. The bots on the devices and malicious scripts used to hack a victim. Botnets can be used to steal data, send spams and execute a DDOS attack."} ,

"Data Management" : {"Can you explain what data management is and why it is important?": "Data management is the overall process of collecting, storing, organizing, maintaining, and using data effectively. It is important because it helps ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and secure, and is used in a way that aligns with the organization’s goals and objectives.", "How do you ensure data quality in a data management program?": "To ensure data quality in a data management program, I implement data validation and reconciliation processes, as well as data standardization and harmonization processes. I also implement proper monitoring and reporting mechanisms, and perform regular data quality assessments to identify and remediate potential issues. I also engage with stakeholders to understand their data requirements and work with them to improve the quality of the data.", "How do you handle data breaches in a data management program?": "To handle data breaches in a data management program, I have a well-defined data breach response plan in place. This plan includes steps for identifying and containing the breach, as well as notifying affected parties and conducting a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the breach. I also implement remediation steps to prevent similar breaches from happening in the future, and regularly review and update the data breach response plan to ensure it remains effective."},


"Data Science & KI": {"What is supervised learning?": "It uses known and labeled data as input. The most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machine", "What is classification?": "In machine learning, classification is a predictive modeling problem where the class label is anticipated for a specific example of input data. For example, in determining handwriting characters, identifying spam, and so on, the classification requires training data with a large number of datasets of input and output. The most common classification algorithms are binary classification, multi-class classification, multi-label classification, and imbalanced classification", "What are common languages and libraries for Data Science": "R, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch", "What are the common evaluation metrics for regression?": "Root mean squared error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)", "Which is the most common clustering algorithm?" : "K-mean clustering algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm."},

"Analytische Chemie": {"Define Compressive Stress And Compressive Strain?": "The stress induced in a body, when subjected to two equal and opposite pushes, as a result of which there is an decrease in length, is known as compressive stress. The ratio of increase in length to th original length is known as compressive strain.", "Define Factor Of Safety?": "It is defined as the of ultimate stress to the working stress or permissible stress.", "What Is Stability?": "The stability may be defined as an ability of a material to withstand high load without deformation.", "What is CAPA?" : "CAPA stands for Corrective Action and Preventive Action, a system for analyzing, correcting, and preventing issues. It outlines procedures to solve the issue, it also analyzes the cause of the problem to prevent its recurrence." },

"Biotechnologie": {"What in Monoclonal antibody technology?": "Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are made up of a single clone of cells. They are homogeneous and are highly useful in diagnostic tests and Research. Kohler and Milstein developed a technology named Hybridoma for the production of MABs.  
Hybridoma is a hybrid cell formed by the fusion of B cells with myeloma cells i.e. tumour cell. The main principle of this technology is that this cell has the capacity to produce antibody which are derived from B cells and at the same time it can divide the quality derived from Myeloma cells. This Technology ensures large scale antibody production (monoclonal antibodies) by combining the desired qualities of both the cells.", "What is Recombinant DNA Technology (rDNA)?": "The two DNA molecules from two different species are joined together when inserted into a host organism to produce new genetic material which will be helpful in medicine, agriculture, industry and science as well. Without gene it is not possible so, main function of genetic laboratory is to isolate, characterize and manipulate genes. Therefore, rDNA technology has made it possible to determine the nucleotide sequence by isolating a gene or any other segment of DNA. With the help of this study of genes, its transcripts, mutation and inserting it into an organism can be understood easily.", "What do you mean by Antisense technology?": "Antisense is an innovative platform for drug discovery. It provides an alternative treatment for the disorders like cancer, viral and parasitic infections. Antisense RNA is a single stranded RNA, which is complimentary to messenger RNA (mRNA) and is transcribed within a cell.", "What are the benefits of Biotechnology?": "This technology helps plants for pest resistance, helps plants to tolerate the stressful conditions like low temperature, drought, salt in soil, etc., helps to generate vaccines for the animals to fight against diseases, it is also used to produce pharmaceuticals etc."},
 
"Electrical Engineering": {"What Are the Main Types of Electric Current?": "Direct Current (DC) and Alternating current (AC)", "What Kinds of Cables Are Used for Power Transmissions?": "Long-distance cables, such as overhead power lines, are classified according to their size and thermal capacity. So we have low-tension cables, which can transmit voltage up to 1,000 volts or one kilovolt (1 kV). Then there are high-tension cables, which transmit between 1 kV and 23,000 volts (23 kV).
